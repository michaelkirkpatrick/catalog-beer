				<p>If, notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms of Use, Catalog.beer is found to be liable to you for any damage or loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with your use of the Site or any Content, Catalog.beer’s liability shall in no event exceed US$100.00. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.</p>

				<h2>Indemnity</h2>
				<hr>

				<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Catalog.beer harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against Catalog.beer by any third party due to or arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site.</p>

				<h2>Violation of These Terms of Use</h2>
				<hr>

				<p>Catalog.beer may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity) if we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Catalog.beer’s rights or property, or the rights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Catalog.beer’s customers. Catalog.beer reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that Catalog.beer deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. Catalog.beer also may disclose your information when Catalog.beer determines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.</p>

				<p>You acknowledge and agree that Catalog.beer may preserve any transmittal or communication by you with Catalog.beer through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, and may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Catalog.beer determines that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with legal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any such data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Catalog.beer, its employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and the public.</p>

You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Catalog.beer, for which monetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Catalog.beer obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that Catalog.beer deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Catalog.beer may have at law or in equity.</p>

				<p>You agree that Catalog.beer may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not limited to) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request by you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material modification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4) unexpected technical issues or problems.</p>
